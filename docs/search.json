    "text": "Snapshot of SCN- at the water-decane interface\n\n\nIn this paper, we expand upon our previous work by studying adsorption to a new nonpolar, liquid-liquid interface. Additionally, we collaborated with Professor Ilan Benjamin from UC Santa Cruz who employed MD simulations to help unravel the individual contributions to the Gibb’s free energy of adsorption.\nAbstract: The adsorption of ions to water-hydrophobe interfaces influences a wide range of phenomena, including chemical reaction rates, ion transport across biological membranes, electrochemical and many catalytic processes; hence, developing a detailed understanding of the behavior of ions at water-hydrophobe interfaces is of central interest. Here, we characterize the adsorption of the chaotropic thiocyanate anion (SCN-) to two prototypical liquid hydrophobic surfaces, water-toluene and water-decane, by surface-sensitive nonlinear spectroscopy, and compare the results against our previous studies of SCN- adsorption to the air-water interface. For these systems, we observe no spectral shift in the charge transfer to solvent spectrum of SCN-, and the Gibb’s free energies of adsorption for these three different interfaces all agree within error. We employ MD simulations to develop a molecular-level understanding of the adsorption mechanism and find that the adsorption for SCN- to both water-toluene and water-decane interfaces is driven by an increase in entropy, with very little enthalpic contribution. This is a qualitatively different mechanism than reported for SCN- adsorption to the air-water and graphene-water interfaces, wherein a favorable enthalpy change was the main driving force, against an unfavorable entropy change."

    "text": "(1) Characterizing Anion Adsorption to Aqueous Interfaces: Toluene-water vs Air-water\n\n\n\nSchematic of Sum-Frequency Experiment Probing Toluene-water Interface\n\n\nAbstract: In this work, we continue our investigation of the behavior of simple ions at aqueous interfaces, employing the combination of two surface-sensitive nonlinear spectroscopy tools, broadband deep UV electronic sum-frequency generation and UV second harmonic generation, to characterize the adsorption of thiocyanate to the interface of water with toluene─a prototypical hydrophobe. We find that both the interfacial spectrum and the Gibbs free energy of adsorption closely match results previously reported for the air–water interface. We observe no relative spectral shift in the higher-energy CTTS transition of thiocyanate, implying similar solvation environments for the two interfaces. Similarly, the Gibbs free energies of adsorption agree within error; however, we expect the respective enthalpic and entropic contributions to differ between the two interfaces, similar to our earlier findings for the air–water versus graphene–water interfaces. Further experiments and theoretical modeling are necessary to quantify the mechanistic differences."
