    "text": "Whats the deal with all of the stray/outdoor cats in Berkeley?\n\n\n\nA small sample of the stray/outdoor cats in Berkeley that I have met over the years!\n\n\nBerkeley is a truly wonderful city. Over the last 5 years, I have enjoyed many aspects of living here - the food, the weather, the geography. Oh, and not to mention … the CATS. Berkeley, for some reason, seems to have an extremely high proportion of outdoor/stray cats. I love it.\nEach neighborhood I have lived in has it’s own unique clowder of cats. Some of them friendly, some of them standoff-ish, all of them delightful. Let’s ball-park estimate the number of outdoor cats in Berkeley. Berkeley is roughly a square city, measuring 5x5 miles, and lets assume that there are 10 blocks in a city mile and lets also assume that each city block has at minimum 1 outdoor/stray cat. That gives us:\n\\[\n25 miles^2  * 10^2  \\frac{blocks}{mile^2} * 10^0 \\frac{cats}{block}=2,500 cats\n\\] At minimum, there are 2,500 stray/outdoor cats in Berkeley. My personal experience tells me the true number must be a lot higher.\nIt is no surprise that the animal shelter in Berkeley is “swamped” with kittens. So, if you, like me, want to make sure all of these cats get into good homes, head down to the Berkeley animal shelter!"

    "text": "Snapshot of SCN- at the water-decane interface\n\n\nIn this paper, we expand upon our previous work by studying adsorption to a new nonpolar, liquid-liquid interface. Additionally, we collaborated with Professor Ilan Benjamin from UC Santa Cruz who employed MD simulations to help unravel the individual contributions to the Gibb’s free energy of adsorption.\nAbstract: The adsorption of ions to water-hydrophobe interfaces influences a wide range of phenomena, including chemical reaction rates, ion transport across biological membranes, electrochemical and many catalytic processes; hence, developing a detailed understanding of the behavior of ions at water-hydrophobe interfaces is of central interest. Here, we characterize the adsorption of the chaotropic thiocyanate anion (SCN-) to two prototypical liquid hydrophobic surfaces, water-toluene and water-decane, by surface-sensitive nonlinear spectroscopy, and compare the results against our previous studies of SCN- adsorption to the air-water interface. For these systems, we observe no spectral shift in the charge transfer to solvent spectrum of SCN-, and the Gibb’s free energies of adsorption for these three different interfaces all agree within error. We employ MD simulations to develop a molecular-level understanding of the adsorption mechanism and find that the adsorption for SCN- to both water-toluene and water-decane interfaces is driven by an increase in entropy, with very little enthalpic contribution. This is a qualitatively different mechanism than reported for SCN- adsorption to the air-water and graphene-water interfaces, wherein a favorable enthalpy change was the main driving force, against an unfavorable entropy change."

We find that both the interfacial spectrum and the Gibbs free energy of adsorption closely match results previously reported for the air–water interface. We observe no relative spectral shift in the higher-energy CTTS transition of thiocyanate, implying similar solvation environments for the two interfaces. Similarly, the Gibbs free energies of adsorption agree within error; however, we expect the respective enthalpic and entropic contributions to differ between the two interfaces, similar to our earlier findings for the air–water versus graphene–water interfaces. Further experiments and theoretical modeling are necessary to quantify the mechanistic differences."
