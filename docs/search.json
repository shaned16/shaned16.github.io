    "text": "In this work, we continue our investigation of the behavior of simple ions at aqueous interfaces, employing the combination of two surface-sensitive nonlinear spectroscopy tools, broadband deep UV electronic sum-frequency generation and UV second harmonic generation, to characterize the adsorption of thiocyanate to the interface of water with toluene─a prototypical hydrophobe. We find that both the interfacial spectrum and the Gibbs free energy of adsorption closely match results previously reported for the air–water interface. We observe no relative spectral shift in the higher-energy CTTS transition of thiocyanate, implying similar solvation environments for the two interfaces. Similarly, the Gibbs free energies of adsorption agree within error; however, we expect the respective enthalpic and entropic contributions to differ between the two interfaces, similar to our earlier findings for the air–water versus graphene–water interfaces. Further experiments and theoretical modeling are necessary to quantify the mechanistic differences."
