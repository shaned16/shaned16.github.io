    "text": "A small sample of the stray/outdoor cats in Berkeley that I have met over the years!\n\n\nBerkeley is a truly wonderful city. Over the last 5 years, I have enjoyed many aspects of living here - the food, the weather, the geography. Oh, and not to mention … the CATS. Berkeley, for some reason, seems to have an extremely high proportion of outdoor/stray cats. I love it.\nEach neighborhood I have lived in has it’s own unique clowder of cats. Some of them friendly, some of them standoff-ish, all of them delightful. Let’s ball-park estimate the number of outdoor cats in Berkeley. Berkeley is roughly a square city, measuring 5x5 miles, and lets assume that there are 10 blocks in a city mile and lets also assume that each city block has at minimum 1 outdoor/stray cat. That gives us:\n\\[\n25 miles^2  * 10^2  \\frac{blocks}{mile^2} * 10^0 \\frac{cats}{block}=2,500 cats\n\\]\nAt minimum, there are 2,500 stray/outdoor cats in Berkeley. My personal experience tells me the true number must be a lot higher.\nIt is no surprise that the animal shelter in Berkeley is “swamped” with kittens. So, if you, like me, want to make sure all of these cats get into good homes, head down to the Berkeley animal shelter!"

    "text": "Research overview: My research is aimed at developing a deep understanding of the behavior of ions and water at aqueous interfaces. This work is motivated from the recent discovery that certain ions can have enhanced concentrations in the interfacial region, relative to their bulk concentration, as well as from the importance that surfaces play in driving much of the chemistry we observe in the natural world (at the ocean surface, reactions inside aerosol droplets, biological membranes, etc.) Our goal then is to develop a mechanistic understanding of what drives ions to aqueous interfaces. Is this driving force general? Is it ion specific? Interface specific? To answer these questions, we measure thermodynamic properties for different ions to different types of interfaces. However, there is one difficulty: probing an interface is exceptionally hard, owing to the fact that the signal from those few molecular layers that constitute an “interface” is quite small when compared to the signal that arises from the very large “bulk” of a material.\nIn order to properly study interfaces, we require special tools, namely second-order nonlinear spectroscopy, which is a surface-selective spectroscopy. Our group has developed multiple techniques for this:\nThese two techniques, combined with simulations, allow us to develop our picture of ion adsorption.\nRecently, we have expanded our arsenal of interface-specific spectroscopy tools through the development of Soft Xray Second Harmonic Generation. This technique combines the element specificity of Xray Spectroscopy with the surface-sensitivity of non-linear optics. We travel to Xray Free Electron Laser facilities, which are unique accelerator facilities that produce extremely bright and coherent Xrays. I am looking forward to future work using this technique!\nBelow, you will find blog-style postings for events related to my research, such as published papers, conferences I have attended, etc. Enjoy - and please reach out to me if you have any questions or would like to discuss any of my work!"

    "text": "(5) [Paper: On The Mechanism of Ion Adsorption to Aqueous Interfaces: Air-water vs Oil-water]\n\n\n\nSnapshot of SCN- at the water-decane interface\n\n\nIn this paper, we expand upon our previous work by studying adsorption to a new nonpolar, liquid-liquid interface. Additionally, we collaborated with Professor Ilan Benjamin from UC Santa Cruz who employed MD simulations to help unravel the individual contributions to the Gibb’s free energy of adsorption.\nAbstract: The adsorption of ions to water-hydrophobe interfaces influences a wide range of phenomena, including chemical reaction rates, ion transport across biological membranes, electrochemical and many catalytic processes; hence, developing a detailed understanding of the behavior of ions at water-hydrophobe interfaces is of central interest. Here, we characterize the adsorption of the chaotropic thiocyanate anion (SCN-) to two prototypical liquid hydrophobic surfaces, water-toluene and water-decane, by surface-sensitive nonlinear spectroscopy, and compare the results against our previous studies of SCN- adsorption to the air-water interface. For these systems, we observe no spectral shift in the charge transfer to solvent spectrum of SCN-, and the Gibb’s free energies of adsorption for these three different interfaces all agree within error. We employ MD simulations to develop a molecular-level understanding of the adsorption mechanism and find that the adsorption for SCN- to both water-toluene and water-decane interfaces is driven by an increase in entropy, with very little enthalpic contribution. This is a qualitatively different mechanism than reported for SCN- adsorption to the air-water and graphene-water interfaces, wherein a favorable enthalpy change was the main driving force, against an unfavorable entropy change."

We find that both the interfacial spectrum and the Gibbs free energy of adsorption closely match results previously reported for the air–water interface. We observe no relative spectral shift in the higher-energy CTTS transition of thiocyanate, implying similar solvation environments for the two interfaces. Similarly, the Gibbs free energies of adsorption agree within error; however, we expect the respective enthalpic and entropic contributions to differ between the two interfaces, similar to our earlier findings for the air–water versus graphene–water interfaces. Further experiments and theoretical modeling are necessary to quantify the mechanistic differences."

    "text": "We use the all-grain method of brewing, as opposed to using an extract. It is a little extra work, but allows more control over the final product, and the process itself is quite fun.\nThe first step on brew day is to grind up all of our base grain and specialty grain. For this recipe, we use roughly 16 pounds of 2-row crystal malt as our base, and 3 pounds of specialty grain. For a stout, the specialty grain is roasted to give those characteristic flavors and aromas of a dark beer.\n\n\n\nMilling our Grain via Electric Drill\n\n\nAll of the crushed malt then gets steeped in hot water at about 155 F for one hour - this is called the “mash”. This hot-water bath hydrates the malt, releases natural enzymes, and those enzymes can then break down the starches into sugar. This is an important step - the sugar produced here is what ultimately gets fermented to alcohol by the yeast later down the line - mashing at the correct temperature is important for good conversion and a good beer.\n\n\n\nSteve and Alex making sure the grain is well mixed\n\n\nAfter the mash, we sparge. Sparging is the process by which we we separate all of those new fermentable sugars from the grain-mash. The contraption for this is neat:\n\n\n\nAlex enjoying some non-homebrew beer while supervising the sparge (not sponsored by Happy’s Spirits and Wines)\n\n\nThe top bucket is filled with water at ~170 F, the middle bucket is our mash, and the bottom 7 gallon kettle is our collection vessel. The process is simple - the top bucket very gentle springles hot water on the mash. This hot water rinses the grain bed and helps push out all of the sugar water - which gets collected in the stainless steel kettle."
