    "text": "We are back! We took quite a hiatus from brewing, but this past weekend we got together and put on our best brewer‚Äôs caps to make one of our favorites - Steve‚Äôs ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre killing me smalls‚Äù Stout. My friend Steve has been honing in this recipe for over 10 years, and it is a phenomenal beer.\nWe use the all-grain method of brewing, as opposed to using an extract. It is a little extra work, but allows more control over the final product, and the process itself is quite fun.\nThe first step on brew day is to grind up all of our base grain and specialty grain. For this recipe, we use roughly 16 pounds of 2-row malt as our base, and 3 pounds of specialty grain. For a stout, the specialty grain is roasted to give those characteristic flavors and aromas of a dark beer.\n\n\n\nMilling our Grain via Electric Drill\n\n\nAll of the crushed malt then gets steeped in hot water at about 155 F for one hour - this is called the ‚Äúmash‚Äù. This hot-water bath hydrates the malt, releases natural enzymes, and those enzymes can then break down the starches into sugar. This is an important step - the sugar produced here is what ultimately gets fermented to alcohol by the yeast later down the line - mashing at the correct temperature is important for good conversion and a good beer.\n\n\n\nSteve and Alex making sure the grain is well mixed\n\n\nAfter the mash, we sparge. Sparging is the process by which we we separate all of those new fermentable sugars from the grain-mash. The contraption for this is neat:\n\n\n\nAlex enjoying some non-homebrew beer while supervising the sparge (not sponsored by Happy‚Äôs Spirits and Wines)\n\n\nThe top bucket is filled with water at ~170 F, the middle bucket is our mash, and the bottom 7 gallon kettle is our collection vessel. The process is simple - the top bucket very gentle sprinkles hot water on the mash. This hot water rinses the grain bed and helps push out all of the sugar water - which gets collected in the stainless steel kettle.\nWe then boil all the liquid in the kettle for an hour, and add hops at different times during the boil. Depending on when you add hops (and what kind) you either contribute bitterness or hop-flavor. Roughly speaking, hops that go in early during the boil contribute bitterness to the beer, and hops added in later will contribute flavor.\nAfter the boil and hop addition, we recirculate the beer to reduce the temperature near ambient levels. At this point, we add yeast, and have officially created a liquid that can be deemed ‚Äúbeer‚Äù. Now all that is left to do is allow the beer to ferment at the correct temperature for 4-8 weeks, depending on what you are brewing. Then enjoy!\nThis stout is just one of many beer styles we have brewed. Others include a delicous hazy IPA modeled after Treehouse‚Äôs famous ‚ÄúJulius‚Äù, a barrel-aged saison, a Hefeweizen, and a pale ale.\nIf you are at all interested in the brewing process, I highly recommend checking out ‚ÄúHow To Brew‚Äù by John Palmer, which takes you through the brew process from start to end in a digestible format.\nHappy brewing! Sl√°inte!"

    "section": "",
    "text": "I recently went on a bike packing trip with my good friend Tyler, who flew out from Boston to log some miles on the west coast.\nTyler and I have been bike packing partners since our junior year of college, which was our first trip together. That ride was a 2-day, 100 mile loop in Western Massachusetts, with the goal of stopping at as many breweries as possible. Day 1 was great - full of beautiful bike riding and delicious beer. Day 2 was a little more sluggish to say the least‚Ä¶ but still a blast. Since then we have been constantly planning more trips together.\nFor this ride, we settled on exploring the Pt.Reyes region north of San Francisco and had mapped out a 4-day ride.\nDay 1: Berkeley -&gt; Samuel P Taylor State Park\nOn Day 1, we left Berkeley at around 10 AM and had an easy first 10 miles biking along the water on the San Francisco Bay Trail, with great views of the SF skyline. We then crossed over the San Rafael bridge (wind advisory!!) and started biking through Marin up towards Pt Reyes.\nAs we moved away from the water and into the San Geronimo Valley, the temperature started rising FAST. Ambient temperatures were over 100 F, but with the sun radiating off of the pavement, I think Tyler and I were experiencing temperatures closer to 110 - 115 F.\nThe physical and metaphorical last hurdle of this ride came as a steep climb about 30 miles in. Tyler and I had to stop just about every 50 feet going up this climb as we were both so physically exhausted from riding in the heat. Finally we made it to the top and started to descend the back side of the hill and saw the most beautiful sight of our lives‚Ä¶ the San Geronimo Valley Community Center was hosting air-conditioned cooling hours due to the heat advisory.\n\n\n\n(left)San Geronimo Valley Cooling Center sign that saved us. (middle)Tyler and I playing cards and soaking up that sweet AC. (right) Shane acting cool while arriving at cooling center\n\n\nTyler and I stayed in the cooling center until it closed down at 5 PM and played cards, hydrated, and ate salted PB&J sandwiches.\nThe last 10 miles to the campsite were a lot easier, and we replenished that night with plenty of fluids and dehydrated mac and cheese.\nDay 2: Samuel P Taylor State Park -&gt; Berkeley\nAfter such a strenuous Day 1, and realizing that the heat advisory was in place for the next few days, Tyler and I decided the best thing was to cut the ride short. The next morning we woke up bright and early and started our ride back to Berkeley before the temperatures got too high.\nWe were bummed to not finish our entire planned route, but that did not stop us from logging some more miles. Back in the Bay, where the temperatures were a lot more mild, Tyler and I went on some great day-rides. Our favorite started in Mill Valley, followed the waterfront through Sausalito, and then climbed the mountains behind the Golden Gate bridge.\n\n\n\n(left) Tyler biking down Hawk Hill, with the Marin Headlands in the background. (middle) Shane flexing on all the haters. (right) Tyler celebrates after conquering a steep climb and is rewarded with a great view of the Golden Gate Bridge\n\n\nTake a closer look at our rides below! With the help of Scout Leonard and most of her code, I pulled the data from Strava and plotted them on a map of the Bay Area. I mainly work in Python, so this was my first experience doing any real coding in R, which was a lot of fun!\nI haven‚Äôt included most of the code chunks. If you are interested in seeing that, check out Scout‚Äôs Post which goes through everything in detail, and will be documented much more neatly than mine. She is a real data scientist!\n\nGiddy Up\nFirst we loaded some new packages that were required for mapping Strava data, including rStrava, googleway, and leaflet. Next was connecting with the Strava API to pull all of my logged activities, and tidying that up into an easy-to-use CSV file.\n\n\nData Filtering\nStrava is a great app in the sense that it collects a ton of useful data for competitive athletes. For washed-up, aging PhD students like me, only a few things are relevant. Here I select a few columns of interest, and then filter the data by type (Ride), the specific dates that we were bike packing, and converted distances into miles and feet instead of km and m.\n\ncolumns_of_interest &lt;- c('distance',\n                         'elapsed_time',\n                         'elev_high',\n                         'elev_low',\n                         'moving_time',\n                         'start_date',\n                         'start_date_local',\n                         'type',\n                         'map.summary_polyline',\n                         'upload_id',\n                         'start_latlng1',\n                         'start_latlng2',\n                         'total_elevation_gain',\n                         'upload_id')\n\nactivities &lt;- select(act_data, match(columns_of_interest,\n                                     names(act_data)))\n\nactivities &lt;- activities %&gt;% \n  mutate(elapsed_time = round(elapsed_time / 60 /60, digits = 2),\n         moving_time = round(moving_time / 60 / 60, digits = 2),\n         total_elevation_gain = round(total_elevation_gain * 3.28084, digits = 0),\n         distance = round(distance*0.621371, digits = 0),\n         date = gsub(\"T.*$\", '', start_date) %&gt;% \n           as.POSIXct(., format = \"%Y-%m-%d\")) %&gt;% \n  rename(latitude = \"start_latlng1\",\n         longitude = \"start_latlng2\") %&gt;% \n  mutate(start_date = as.Date(start_date_local)) \n  \nactivities &lt;- activities %&gt;% \n  filter(type == \"Ride\",\n         \"2022-09-10\" &gt; start_date,\n           start_date &gt; \"2022-09-05\")\n\n\n\nMap it\nHere we use leaflet to make a blank map and set the coordinates to focus on the region of interest. Lastly, we use polyline encoding to display the coordinates associated with an activity over the map.

    "text": "Current Work\nCurrently, I am interested in pushing the frontiers of Soft X-ray spectroscopy tools for the study of interfaces. As an Advanced Light Source Postdoctoral Fellow, I am working in the group of Moni Blum at the Lawrence Berkeley National Lab to develop the use of planar liquid sheets with X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy. This technique can selectively probe specific elements at various depths from the interface and is a powerful tool for understanding the spatial profile and number densities of various species in solution.\nAdditionally, I am working with Craig Schwartz (UNLV) and Walter Drisdell (LBNL) to develop Soft X-ray Second Harmonic Generation Spectroscopy. This technique combines the element specificity of X-ray Spectroscopy with the surface-sensitivity of nonlinear optics. We travel to X-ray Free Electron Lasers, which are unique accelerator facilities that produce extremely bright and coherent X-rays to conduct experiments on liquids and clean energy materials, such as perovskite solar cells and Si-based solar cells.\nPhD work\nMy PhD was aimed at developing a deep understanding of the behavior of ions and water at aqueous interfaces. This work is motivated by the recent discovery that certain ions have enhanced concentrations in the interfacial region, relative to their bulk concentration, as well as from the importance that surfaces play in driving much of the chemistry we observe in the natural world (at the ocean surface, reactions inside aerosol droplets, biological membranes, etc.) Our goal is to develop a mechanistic understanding of what drives ions to aqueous interfaces. Is this driving force general? Is it ion specific? Interface specific? To answer these questions, we measure thermodynamic properties for different ions to different types of interfaces.\nIn order to properly study interfaces we require special tools: second-order nonlinear spectroscopy, which is a surface-selective spectroscopy. Our group has developed multiple techniques for this:\nThese two techniques, combined with simulations, allowed us to develop a detailed picture of ion adsorption.\nBelow, you will find blog-style postings for events related to my research, such as published papers, conferences I have attended, etc. Enjoy - and please reach out to me if you have any questions or would like to discuss any of my work!"

    "text": "(6) Paper: Agglomeration Drives the Reversed Fractionation of Carbonate and Bicarbonate at the Air-water Interface\nJournal of the American Chemical Society - September 2023 \nIn this paper, we measure the surface affinity of the carbonate and bicarbonate anions to the air-water interface, a vitally important system in atmospheric aerosol and ocean-surface chemistry. We find that doubly-charged carbonate exhibits stronger attraction to the surface than does singly-charged bicarbonate, contradicting long-standing classical electrostatic theory and current predictions from ion adsorption models. Through MD simulations, we found that strong ion pairing, resulting in the formation on large, near-neutral clusters of sodium cations and carbonate anions, is responsible for this behavior. These agglomerates show much stronger surface affinity over the bicarbonate anions, which do not cluster in aqueous solutions. These findings will have influence our understanding of carbon dioxide dissolution in the ocean, as well as how pH in small aerosol droplets might influence reaction kinetics and pathways.\nThe news team at the Lawrence Berkeley National Lab did a story on our findings, which can be accessed here."

Additionally, we collaborated with Professor Ilan Benjamin from UC Santa Cruz who employed MD simulations to help unravel the individual contributions to the Gibb‚Äôs free energy of adsorption.\nAbstract: The adsorption of ions to water-hydrophobe interfaces influences a wide range of phenomena, including chemical reaction rates, ion transport across biological membranes, electrochemical and many catalytic processes; hence, developing a detailed understanding of the behavior of ions at water-hydrophobe interfaces is of central interest. Here, we characterize the adsorption of the chaotropic thiocyanate anion (SCN-) to two prototypical liquid hydrophobic surfaces, water-toluene and water-decane, by surface-sensitive nonlinear spectroscopy, and compare the results against our previous studies of SCN- adsorption to the air-water interface. For these systems, we observe no spectral shift in the charge transfer to solvent spectrum of SCN-, and the Gibb‚Äôs free energies of adsorption for these three different interfaces all agree within error. We employ MD simulations to develop a molecular-level understanding of the adsorption mechanism and find that the adsorption for SCN- to both water-toluene and water-decane interfaces is driven by an increase in entropy, with very little enthalpic contribution. This is a qualitatively different mechanism than reported for SCN- adsorption to the air-water and graphene-water interfaces, wherein a favorable enthalpy change was the main driving force, against an unfavorable entropy change."

    "text": "(1) Paper: Characterizing Anion Adsorption to Aqueous Interfaces: Toluene-water vs Air-water\nJournal of Physical Chemistry Letters - December 2021\n\n\n\nSchematic of Sum-Frequency Experiment Probing Toluene-water Interface\n\n\nAbstract: In this work, we continue our investigation of the behavior of simple ions at aqueous interfaces, employing the combination of two surface-sensitive nonlinear spectroscopy tools, broadband deep UV electronic sum-frequency generation and UV second harmonic generation, to characterize the adsorption of thiocyanate to the interface of water with toluene‚îÄa prototypical hydrophobe. We find that both the interfacial spectrum and the Gibbs free energy of adsorption closely match results previously reported for the air‚Äìwater interface. We observe no relative spectral shift in the higher-energy CTTS transition of thiocyanate, implying similar solvation environments for the two interfaces. Similarly, the Gibbs free energies of adsorption agree within error; however, we expect the respective enthalpic and entropic contributions to differ between the two interfaces, similar to our earlier findings for the air‚Äìwater versus graphene‚Äìwater interfaces. Further experiments and theoretical modeling are necessary to quantify the mechanistic differences."

    "text": "A small sample of the stray/outdoor cats in Berkeley that I have met over the years!\n\n\nBerkeley is a truly wonderful city. Over the last 5 years, I have enjoyed many aspects of living here - the food, the weather, the geography. Oh, and not to mention ‚Ä¶ the CATS. Berkeley, for some reason, seems to have an extremely high proportion of outdoor/stray cats. I love it.\nEach neighborhood I have lived in has it‚Äôs own unique clowder of cats. Some of them friendly, some of them standoff-ish, all of them delightful. Let‚Äôs ball-park estimate the number of outdoor cats in Berkeley. Berkeley is roughly a square city, measuring 5x5 miles, and lets assume that there are 10 blocks in a city mile and lets also assume that each city block has at minimum 1 outdoor/stray cat. That gives us:\n\\[\n25miles^2 * 10^2 \\frac{blocks}{mile^2} * 10^0 \\frac{cats}{block}=2,500 cats\n\\]\nAt minimum, there are 2,500 stray/outdoor cats in Berkeley. My personal experience tells me the true number must be a lot higher.\nIt is no surprise that the animal shelter in Berkeley is ‚Äúswamped‚Äù with kittens. So, if you, like me, want to make sure all of these cats get into good homes, head down to the Berkeley animal shelter!"

    "text": "In June, we adopted our new cat, Marmee, from the Berkeley Humane Shelter! She is a domestic short-haired brown tabby, named after the mother, ‚ÄúMarmee‚Äù, from Little Women. In some ways the name is ironic, since our Marmee can never be a mother. She came home to us spayed - with the blue tattoo to prove it.\nI plan to update this soon with lot of information about our favorite girl. For now, just enjoy this picture.\n\n\n\nTongues out!"
