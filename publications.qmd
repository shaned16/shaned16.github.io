Research Interests: My research is aimed at uncovering a deep understanding of the behavior of ions and water at aqueous interfaces. This work is motivated from the recent discovery that certain ions can have enhanced concentrations in the interfacial region, relative to their bulk concentration, as well as from the importance that surfaces play in driving much of the chemistry we observe in the natural world (at the ocean surface, reactions inside aerosol droplets, biological membranes, etc.) Our goal then is to develop a mechanistic understanding of **what drives ions to aqueous interfaces**. Is this driving force general? Is it ion specific? Interface specific? To answer these questions, we have measured thermodynamic properties for different ions to different types of interfaces. However, there is one difficulty: probing an interface is exceptionally hard, owing to the fact that the signal from those few molecular layers that constitute an "interface" is quite small when compared to the signal that arises from the very large "bulk" of a material.

In order to properly study interfaces, we require special tools, namely second-order nonlinear spectroscopy, which is a **surface-selective** spectroscopy.  Our group has developed multiple techniques for this:

(1) Resonantly enhanced deep-UV Second Harmonic Generation spectroscopy: with this experiment, we are able to measure the thermodynamics of ion adsorption
(2) Broadband deep-UV Electronic Sum-Frequency Generation spectroscopy: with this experiment, we are able to capturing an entire spectrum in the UV with a single laser pulse, which reports information on the solvation environment of the ion at the interface. 

These two techniques, combined with simulations, allow us to develop our picture of ion adsorption. 

Recently, we have expanded our arsenal of interface-specific spectroscopy tools through the development of Soft Xray Second Harmonic Generation. This technique combines the element specificity of Xray Spectroscopy with the surface-sensitive of non-linear optics.

In this paper, we expand upon our previous work by studying adsorption to a new nonpolar, liquid-liquid interface. Additionally, we collaborated with Professor Ilan Benjamin from UC Santa Cruz who employed MD simulations to help unravel the individual contributions to the Gibb's free energy of adsorption.

**Abstract**: The adsorption of ions to water-hydrophobe interfaces influences a wide range of phenomena, including chemical reaction rates, ion transport across biological membranes, electrochemical and many catalytic processes; hence, developing a detailed understanding of the behavior of ions at water-hydrophobe interfaces is of central interest. Here, we characterize the adsorption of the chaotropic thiocyanate anion (SCN-) to two prototypical liquid hydrophobic surfaces, water-toluene and water-decane, by surface-sensitive nonlinear spectroscopy, and compare the results against our previous studies of SCN- adsorption to the air-water interface. For these systems, we observe no spectral shift in the charge transfer to solvent spectrum of SCN-, and the Gibb's free energies of adsorption for these three different interfaces all agree within error. We employ MD simulations to develop a molecular-level understanding of the adsorption mechanism and find that the adsorption for SCN- to both water-toluene and water-decane interfaces is driven by an increase in entropy, with very little enthalpic contribution. This is a qualitatively different mechanism than reported for SCN- adsorption to the air-water and graphene-water interfaces, wherein a favorable enthalpy change was the main driving force, against an unfavorable entropy change.

**Pulse Institute; Stanford Linear Accelerator (SLAC), Menlo Park, CA - June 2022**

The UXSS is a four day conference hosted annually by Stanford University's PULSE Institute.

The goal is to disseminate information and train students and post-docs on new opportunities in ultrafast science, particularly using X-ray Free Electron Lasers. Lectures were presented by expert scientists in this exciting new field.

I had a great time attending lectures, meeting students from different XFEL facilities around the world, and working on collaborative data analysis projects!

## (3) Awards: Department of Chemistry Teaching Awards

**UC Berkeley - April 2022**

This month I received two teaching awards!

**Chemistry Instructional Achievement Award**: This is awarded by the department of chemistry to graduate students who have had a significant impact on student success and/or curriculum development. Awardees were selected by evaluation over their entire instructional career (for me, three semesters of teaching) and were based on faculty nominations and student feedback.

**Outstanding Graduate Student Instructor (GSI) Teaching Award**: This is awarded by the Graduate Student Teaching and Resource Center and is given to GSI's with exceptional achievements in teaching.

## (2) [Conference: American Chemical Society Meeting](https://www.morressier.com/o/event/623377e0b300ee00119b311f)

**San Diego, CA - March 2022**

In March of 2022, I attended the American Chemical Society meeting in San Diego, CA with two of my labmates. Apart from enjoying the SoCal sunshine, I had stimulating discussions with graduates students and professors from around the country, attended talks from many leaders in the field of surface science, and presented a poster on my research at the physical chemistry poster session.

**Abstract**: In this work, we continue our investigation of the behavior of simple ions at aqueous interfaces, employing the combination of two surface-sensitive nonlinear spectroscopy tools, broadband deep UV electronic sum-frequency generation and UV second harmonic generation, to characterize the adsorption of thiocyanate to the interface of water with tolueneâ”€a prototypical hydrophobe. We find that both the interfacial spectrum and the Gibbs free energy of adsorption closely match results previously reported for the air--water interface. We observe no relative spectral shift in the higher-energy CTTS transition of thiocyanate, implying similar solvation environments for the two interfaces. Similarly, the Gibbs free energies of adsorption agree within error; however, we expect the respective enthalpic and entropic contributions to differ between the two interfaces, similar to our earlier findings for the air--water versus graphene--water interfaces. Further experiments and theoretical modeling are necessary to quantify the mechanistic differences.
