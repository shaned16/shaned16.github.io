In June, we adopted our new cat, Marmee, from the [Berkeley Humane Shelter](https://berkeleyhumane.org/adopt/)! She is a domestic short-haired brown tabby, named after the mother, "Marmee", from Little Women. In some ways the name is ironic, since our Marmee can never be a mother. She came home to us spayed - with the blue tattoo to prove it.

I plan to update this soon with lot of information about our favorite girl. For now, just enjoy this picture.
