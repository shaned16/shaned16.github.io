I recently went on a bike packing trip with my good friend [Tyler](https://tylerkindy.com), who flew out from Boston to log some miles on the west coast.

Tyler and I have been bike packing partners since our junior year of college, which was our first trip together. That ride was a 2-day, 100 mile loop in Western Massachusetts, with the goal of stopping at as many breweries as possible. Day 1 was great - full of beautiful bike riding and delicious beer. Day 2 was a little more sluggish to say the least... but still a blast. Since then we have been constantly planning more trips together.

For this ride, we settled on exploring the Pt.Reyes region north of San Francisco and had mapped out a 4-day ride.

**Day 1: Berkeley -\> Samuel P Taylor State Park**

On Day 1, we left Berkeley at around 10 AM and had an easy first 10 miles biking along the water on the San Francisco Bay Trail, with great views of the SF skyline. We then crossed over the San Rafael bridge (wind advisory!!) and started biking through Marin up towards Pt Reyes.

As we moved away from the water and into the San Geronimo Valley, the temperature started rising FAST. Ambient temperatures were over 100 F, but with the sun radiating off of the pavement, I think Tyler and I were experiencing temperatures closer to 110 - 115 F.

The physical and metaphorical last hurdle of this ride came as a steep climb about 30 miles in. Tyler and I had to stop just about every 50 feet going up this climb as we were both so physically exhausted from riding in the heat. Finally we made it to the top and started to descend the back side of the hill and saw the most beautiful sight of our lives... the San Geronimo Valley Community Center was hosting air-conditioned cooling hours due to the heat advisory.

Tyler and I stayed in the cooling center until it closed down at 5 PM and played cards, hydrated, and ate salted PB&J sandwiches.

The last 10 miles to the campsite were a lot easier, and we replenished that night with plenty of fluids and dehydrated mac and cheese.

After such a strenuous Day 1, and realizing that the heat advisory was in place for the next few days, Tyler and I decided the best thing was to cut the ride short. The next morning we woke up bright and early and started our ride back to Berkeley before the temperatures got too high.

We were bummed to not finish our entire planned route, but that did not stop us from logging some more miles. Back in the Bay, where the temperatures were a lot more mild, Tyler and I went on some great day-rides. Our favorite started in Mill Valley, followed the waterfront through Sausalito, and then climbed the mountains behind the Golden Gate bridge.
