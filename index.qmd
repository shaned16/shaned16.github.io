## **Hello!**

I am currently an Advanced Light Source Postdoctoral Fellow working at the Lawrence Berkeley National Lab. As an experimental physical chemist, I am interested in a fundamental understanding of how water and ions behave at surfaces, and the role this plays in environmentally and atmospherically relevant systems. I am currently using X-ray techniques, such as Ambient Pressure X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy and Soft X-ray Second Harmonic Generation to address these questions.

I recently completed my PhD at the University of California, Berkeley. Check out my [research](publications.qmd) page for more information about what I have been working on!

For personal musings, check out [THIS](fun_blog.qmd) page!
