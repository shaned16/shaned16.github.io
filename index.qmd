## **Hello!**

I am a PhD Candidate in the UC Berkeley Department of Chemistry. As an experimental physical chemist, I am interested in a fundamental understanding of how water and ions behave at surfaces, and the role this plays in environmentally and atmospherically relevant systems. Check out my [research](publications.qmd) page for more information about the work that I do!
